	The notion of an active shape and a grid were drawn from a previous implmentation 
	of tetris made by Dillon Allan in C#: 
	https://github.com/dlallan/TetrisInCSharp
	(Do note that this DID NOT mean that code was reused from the C# project.
	 Implementing Tetris in Python was a completely new experience for both team members.)
